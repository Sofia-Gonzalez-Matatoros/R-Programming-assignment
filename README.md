# 1. Introduction to causal inference
According to the Encyclopedia Britannica (2022), induction is a means of reasoning from a particulars to generals and one example of this is causal inference. The objectif of this process is to infer the actual effect of a particular element within a more complex system, considering the global outcome under changing conditions (Pearl & Judea, 2009). At this point is important to clarify that association does not imply causation, in other words, two elements can be related because they belongt to the same interacting network, but its relationship cannot be due to a cause-effect.
