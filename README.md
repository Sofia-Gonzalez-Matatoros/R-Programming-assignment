# 1. Introduction to causal inference
According to the Encyclopedia Britannica (2022), induction is a means of reasoning from particulars to generals and one example of this is causal inference. The objective of this process is to infer the actual effect of a particular element within a more complex system, considering the global outcome under changing conditions (Pearl & Judea, 2009). At this point, it is important to clarify that association does not imply causation, in other words, two elements can be related because they belong to the same interacting network, but its relationship cannot be due to a cause-effect process.

Back to the initial topic, when we want to make an interpretation of the statistical results in this type of scenarios, a relevant aspect is to choose on which covariates we are going to adjust in the analysis. Therefore, the aim of this report is to explain which are the consequences of doing an incorrect analysis, since we are aware that the process of causal inference is highly used in biomedical research.
